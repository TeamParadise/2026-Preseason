 * A class that represents a {@link SubsystemBase} with an overridable state machine implementation.

 * which can be useful to add manual controls to a codebase that is using a {@link RobotManager}
 * instance as a central point of control.
 *
 * <p>To make sure overrides work correctly, a standard automation command should only ever require
 * a {@link RobotManager} instance (not the individual subsystems), and an override/manual command
 * should require individual subsystems.

/**
 * A class that represents a {@link SubsystemBase} with an overridable state machine implementation.
 *
 * <p>This state machine can also work with goal states, allowing the subsystem to report whether it
 * is within a certain threshold of its target setpoint. This is useful for automation—such as
 * initiating movement, scoring, or other actions—once the subsystem has reached its final goal.
 *
 * <p>You must implement a proper method (e.g., {@code atGoal()}) to evaluate whether the subsystem
 * is at its goal. This is not provided by default, as different subsystems may require different
 * tolerances or logic (for example, estimating the goal of a drive base will require multiple
 * tolerance values, compared to most other linear or spinning mechanisms).
